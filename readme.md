## Super Awesome Form!

This is a simple example of a site that takes input in a form and on the next page it will show you the information that was input.
you can check it out [here](http://simpleform.humpherys.xyz)

---------

### Extra Features

I added a home page. This is just a page that allows you to navigate through the app. It is just to make things look pretty.

#### Twitter's Bootstrap

This app uses the Bootstrap framework. There is no Custom CSS. It is fully responsive and works on devices of all sizes

#### MySQL Database

This app uses a MySQL Database to store the information entered in the form. In order for you to test the app completely you can check out where I have it [hosted](http://simpleform.humpherys.xyz) or you can spin up your own database, import your own .env file that links to that database and test it on your own locally hosted system.

#### Laravel Framework

This project was developed entirely in [Laravel](http://laravel.com)

#### Hosting

I am hosting this app at [simpleform.humpherys.xyz](http://simpleform.humpherys.xyz). Feel free to go and check it out!
