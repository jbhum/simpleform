## Super Awesome Form!

This is a simple example of a site that takes input in a form and on the next page it will show you the information that was input.

### Extra Features

I added a home page. This is just a page that allows you to navigate through the app. It is just to make things look pretty.

#### Twitter's Bootstrap

This app uses the Bootstrap framework. There is no Custom CSS. It is fully responsive and works on devices of all sizes

#### MySQL Database

This app uses a MySQL Database to store the information entered in the form. 

#### Laravel Framework

This project was developed entirely in [Laravel](http://laravel.com)

#### Hosting

I am hosting this app at [jbhum.cloudapp.net](http://jbhum.cloudapp.net). Feel free to go and check it out!
